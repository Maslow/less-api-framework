title: Cloud Function History Logs

# {{ $frontmatter.title }}

:::warning
Only logs generated by using `console` in cloud functions will be saved!
:::

All historical logs of cloud functions are automatically saved in the log section, and logs are retained for 3 days.

You can filter logs based on the `requestId` and the name of the cloud function.

1. Click on a log to switch to the log section.
2. Use the `requestId` and the name of the cloud function to search for specific logs.
3. Click on an individual log to view detailed content.

## Manual Log Cleaning

The running logs of Laf cloud functions are stored in a hidden collection called `__function_logs__`. Therefore, we can use the method to manipulate the database in cloud functions to clean the logs.

The following is the code to clean all logs in a cloud function:

::: danger
The following operation will delete all historical logs. Please proceed with caution.
:::

```typescript
import cloud from '@lafjs/cloud'

export async function main(ctx: FunctionContext) {
  console.log('Hello World')
  // Database, remove all logs
  const db = cloud.database();
  const res = await db.collection('__function_logs__').remove({multi:true})
  console.log(res)
}
```
