# instance

Instance is a Kubernetes controller that manages the lifecycle of an app instance.

When an instance is created, the instance controller is responsible for creating its corresponding deployment (pod & containers) in the specified cluster.

## Terms

- `instance` 
  - is a crd that represents an app instance resource (deployment / pod / containers)
  - is created by the application controller while the application state is desired to be `Running`
  - is deleted by the application controller while the application state is desired to be `Stopped`
  - is created in the same namespace as the application
  - is created with the same name as the application
  - is associated with the application based on appid
  - must be created in the corresponding cluster that associated with same region as the application
  - manages the lifecycle of the deployment / pod / containers of the application

- `cluster`
  - is a crd that represents a kubernetes cluster
  - must be a cluster accessible in the instance controller
  - provides the necessary information for accessing the cluster, including the kubeconfig of the cluster, etc.
  - can only hold instances that are associated with the same region

## Scenario

- application controller will create an instance when a application is desired to be `Running`.
- application controller will delete an instance when a application is desired to be `Stopped`.
- The instance controller needs to select a suitable cluster according to the instance's region.
- The instance controller needs to obtain the app's runtime & bundle configuration based on the instance's appid to create the deployment(pod & containers).

## Work Flow

- The application controller creates an instance when an application is desired to be `Running`.
  1. The instance controller selects a suitable cluster according to the instance's region.
  2. The instance controller obtains the app's runtime & bundle configuration based on the instance's appid to create the deployment(pod & containers).
  3. The instance controller connects to the cluster and creates the deployment with the runtime & bundle configuration obtained in step 3.
  4. The instance controller marks the instance's `created condition` to `true` when the deployment is created successfully.
  5. The instance controller marks the instance's `ready condition` to `true` when the deployment is ready.

- The application controller deletes an instance when an application is desired to be `Stopped`.
  1. The instance controller connects to the cluster and deletes the deployment.
  2. The instance controller marks the instance's `created condition` to `false` when the deployment is deleted successfully.
  3. The instance controller marks the instance's `ready condition` to `false` when the deployment is deleted successfully.
  4. The instance controller deletes the instance.

## In Future

- Instance may support scaling in the future.

## Getting Started

Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster

1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/instance:tag
```

3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/instance:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs

To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller

UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing

// TODO(user): Add detailed information on how you would like others to contribute to this project

### How it works

This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/)
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster

### Test It Out

1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions

If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
